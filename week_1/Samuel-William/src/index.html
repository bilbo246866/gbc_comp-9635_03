			<h3>I am an aspiring front-end developer currently seeking opportunities..</h3>

			<h4>Experience</h4>
			<p>
			The majority of my work experience in the technology sector has involved support roles
			and I have been employed over the years in a technical support role in various forms, reaching back
			to the late 1980s / early 90's. I have worked as a technical analyst, network analyst, desktop support
			specialist, Network Administrator, Server Administrator, Level 2 Service Desk and Telecom Analyst.</p>
			<p>In 2015 after a downsizing, I decided it was time to change direction and dive into the world of Web 
			Design and Development. I enjoyed the idea of creating something using technology rather than fixing, or cleaning
			up someone else's disaster. I enrolled at George Brown College in the Continuing Education department and started my first
			course called Introduction to Web Design and Development. That was in the summer of 2015 and have not looked back since.
			I've enjoyed completing all of the projects for my classes, both in Web Design and Web Development.</p> <p>The trick is to not stop "doing"
			because even if you take a break for just a couple of months a lot can be forgotten, therefore I constantly need to refresh my knowledge, especially in Javascript and jQuery. As far as solid work experience in Development I have to say that I currently don't have too much.
			Some of the work I do has been volunteer work and I have volunteer mentored at an outfit called "Ladies learning code" which is part of "Canada Learning Code" and helps to teach code to groups of people all across the country. I did this on the recommendation of one of my instructors and I quite enjoy the helping aspect of the job, and it can be a good refresher as well, you're learning as well as assisting the instructor! Beyond this, there's a few Web pages I have updated for friends and acquaintances in exchange for their endorsement. My main priority right now is to create an online portfolio and showcase some Web pages and Web apps.</p>

			<p>I look forward to learning many great things in this advanced Javascript class.

			 	<h4>Location</h4>
				 <p>
				 I have lived in Toronto for the last 30 years, and own a home in Midtown 
				 Toronto. I would be willing to travel if the right opportunity came up, and if 
				 working remotely was an option, then I would do it. Since Toronto
				 is a well-known tech hub, with many established companies and startups based here,
				 it would seem logical to begin a job search with Toronto, or the GTA. I understand that Vancouver 
				 is a tech hub as well and while the milder winters might attract many job seekers, the high cost 
				 of living in Vancouver seems a negative. Don't know much about the job situation in Calgary (I come from
				 Alberta, - a great place to live and work) same with Ottawa - don't know much about it.
				 I definitely would NOT want to live or work in the United States.</p>

		 	<h4>Hobbies</h4>
		 	<p>
		 	I enjoy Photography and probably spend too much on equipment to indulge in this.
		    My focus over the last couple of years has been with people photography. So I've been
		    getting people to "pose"  for "headshots" and Portraits, using studio lighting
		    or simply just speedlight flash when a studio is not an option. I'd like to try my hand at Pet Photography
		    which could be a challenge because some animals don't like to stay still for very long.</p>

	    	 <p>I enjoy music, both listening to and playing. Lately I've become interested in Jazz. It's definitely 
		 	 	more difficult to play Jazz though. I've been learning to play the Ukelele.</p>

		 	 <p>Outdoors Stuff: Hiking, Road-Cycling, Skiing, Gardening, tried Mountain Biking a few times. Camping and travelling
		 	 	around Ontario. </p>
		 	 <p>Here's a photo of my cat, who will actually stay still for a pose.</p>
